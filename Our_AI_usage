We used ChatGPT when doing this project. Precise usage is explained below:
  - Hanna Milnikel: after writing some parts of my podcast script, I used Chat to rewrite it in less "writing" style and in more relaxed way;
                    also I had some problems with github Large Files Storage, so I also asked Chat for help but I ended up using github step
                    by step explanation
  - Karina Dal: I used AI in helping me creating the circular plot and adjusting the heatmap colors in my other plot; 
                    I also used AI to help me analyze long descriptive answers of the respondents from the poll and summarise their opinions on open questiona
  - Ewa Lendzion: I used AI to help me detect and correct grammar or logical mistakes I made while preparing my parts for the podcast
  - Agata Zając: I used AI to help me rewrite some parts of my podcast part. I also used it to generate one image for the logo (the molecule with headphones) 
                 since I couldn’t find a suitable one on the internet.
